# Teams Graph API Connector

#Purpose: 
#The goal for this GITHUB repo and its contents are to provide you an alternative way to directly connect to Microsoft Teams via a Custom Connector action. Currently the actions in Power Automate for Microsoft Teams are still in Preview at the time of this posting hence the original development of this connector. If you are curious on how to configure the Custom Connector or the custom connector with the Graph API feel free to reach out or review the articles I’ve written on this topic.
